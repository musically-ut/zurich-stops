The Zurich data was obtained from the [Urban Data Challenge repository](https://github.com/swissnexSF/Urban-Data-Challenge/tree/master/public-transportation/zurich/geo/geojson).

The visualisation was built with help from the excellent [introductory tutorial](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/) by [Mike Bostock](https://github.com/mbostock).
